This work is derivative of the Nurse Quacky schematic posted at https://home-wrecker.com/nurse-quacky.html.

Copied from the schematic author at https://runoffgroove.com:

runoffgroove.com projects are provided free-of-charge to builders for personal, non-commercial use. 
We do offer licensing for builders who wish to sell pedals based on, in whole or in part, our projects. 
As part of the licensing agreement, the builder must clearly state that the circuit was developed by runoffgroove.com, both in promotional literature and on the circuit board. 
If you see a pedal for sale that seems to be based on a runoffgroove.com project and does not credit us, the builder may not be officially licensed by us and therefore, not compensating us as the developer. 
Please contact us with the information and we will investigate the situation. Thank you.
